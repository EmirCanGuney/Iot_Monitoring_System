# IoT Monitoring System

This project is an **IoT-based monitoring platform** designed to collect, process, and analyze sensor data using the **MQTT protocol**.  
It follows a **microservices architecture** built with **Spring Boot**, enabling scalable data processing, alert management, and real-time monitoring.

###  Key Features
- Sensor data ingestion via MQTT
- Microservice-based modular design (Data Processing, Alert, MQTT Listener)
- Kafka integration for event-driven communication
- Docker Compose setup for containerized deployment
- Python-based simulator for sensor data generation

###  Technologies
**Java**, **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **Docker**, **MQTT**, **Python**
